```{r}
# Import and check out data
library(tidyverse)
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```


# Exercise 1
```{r}
ggplot(data = education, aes(x = sat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
Almost a normal distribution, maybe a little bit skewed right

# Exercise 2
```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(data = education, aes(x = sat, y = expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot
```
