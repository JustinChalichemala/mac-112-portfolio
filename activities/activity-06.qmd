# Exercise 1
```{r}
fave_places <- read.csv("https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/our_fave_places.csv")
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)

```
```{r}
leaflet(data = fave_places) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers()
```

# Exercise 2
```{r}
# Load package needed to change color
library(gplots)

# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location
leaflet(data = fave_places) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircles(color = col2hex("red"))
```
```{r}
# We can change the background
# Mark locations with yellow dots
# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines
# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)
leaflet(data = fave_places) %>%
  addProviderTiles("USGS") %>%
  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex("yellow")) %>%
  addPolylines(
    lng = ~longitude,
    lat = ~latitude,
    color = col2hex("green")
  )
```

# Exercise 3
```{r}
# Import starbucks location data
starbucks <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv")
```

```{r}
# Don't worry about the syntax
starbucks_mn <- starbucks %>%   
  filter(Country == "US", State.Province == "MN")

leaflet(data = starbucks_mn) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers()

ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2)
```

# Exercise 4
```{r}
# Load the package
library(rnaturalearth)

# Get info about country boundaries across the world
# in a "sf" or simple feature format
world_boundaries <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")
```
```{r}
# What does this code produce?
# What geom are we using for the point map?
ggplot(world_boundaries) + 
  geom_sf()
```
```{r}
# Load package needed to change map theme
library(mosaic)

# Add a point for each Starbucks
# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries
# How does this change how we use geom_point?!
ggplot(world_boundaries) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  geom_point(
    data = starbucks,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),
    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = "darkgreen"
  ) +
  theme_map()
```
Most of the Starbucks locations happen in the northern part of the hemisphere, with a majority being in the U.S, Britain, and Japan.

```{r}
# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.
starbucks_cma <- starbucks %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))
```

```{r}
cma_boundaries <- ne_states(
  country = c("canada", "mexico", "united states of america"),
  returnclass = "sf")
```
